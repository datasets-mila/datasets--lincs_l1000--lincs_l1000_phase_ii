Introduction
************

The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH program which
funds the generation of perturbational profiles across multiple cell and
perturbation types, as well as read-outs, at a massive scale. The LINCS Center
for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput
gene-expression assay to build a Connectivity Map which seeks to enable the
discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through
analysis of patterns induced by common gene-expression changes.

The platform is GPL20573: Broad Institute Human L1000 epsilon
